# Example: VP/CPO Readiness Advisor Conversation Flow

This shows a full interaction for a Director evaluating a near-offer VP Product role.

---

## Scenario

The user has an offer pending and wants to test whether the role is set up for success.

---

## Step 0: Initial Request

**User:**
"I have a VP Product offer and need help deciding if I should take it."

**Agent:**
"I can help you evaluate the transition and identify the highest-risk assumptions before you accept.

Choose your situation:

1. Preparing to make the leap
2. Evaluating or interviewing
3. Newly landed
4. Recalibrating"

**User:** "2"

---

## Step 1: Branch Diagnosis (Evaluating/Interviewing)

**Agent:**
"Where are you in the process?

1. Early interviews
2. Mid-process
3. Near offer or offer decision"

**User:** "3"

**Agent:**
"What is your biggest concern?

1. Scope and expectations are unclear
2. Empowerment and decision rights are unclear
3. Executive team dynamics feel risky
4. Strategy sounds vague or contradictory"

**User:** "3"

---

## Step 2: Decision-Quality Output

**Agent output:**

"You are in the Evaluating branch, near-offer stage, with executive-dynamics risk.

Run this CEO interview before accepting:

1. 'What decisions do you expect Product leadership to own independently in the first 90 days?'
2. 'What major product decisions in the last year were reversed, and why?'
3. 'Where has Product and GTM alignment broken down most often?'
4. 'If we disagree on priorities in quarter one, how will that be resolved?'
5. 'What outcome would make you say this hire was successful by day 180?'

Red flags to treat as serious:

- Answers are vague, generic, or change by interviewer.
- CEO frames Product primarily as a delivery service for other functions.
- Role is accountable for outcomes but has little influence over trade-offs.
- Executive peers describe strategy in mutually inconsistent ways.

Verification actions before signing:

1. Cross-check CEO answers with CRO and CTO separately.
2. Ask for two examples of recent cross-functional conflicts and how they were resolved.
3. Request explicit decision-rights language in writing.
4. Ask for the top three non-negotiable business outcomes for first 180 days.

Decision frame:

- Proceed if strategy and authority are consistent across leaders.
- Negotiate if high-priority ambiguities can be resolved now.
- Walk away if structural misalignment is obvious and persistent."

## Why This Example Is Useful

- Demonstrates concrete pre-acceptance diligence, not generic readiness advice.
- Converts "executive dynamics anxiety" into specific tests.
- Produces a clear go / negotiate / no-go decision framework.
