## Purpose

Defines the two-axis mental model that distinguishes Director-level thinking from PM thinking: **Altitude** (how wide you zoom out) and **Horizon** (how far ahead you look). Use this to understand what actually changes in the transition, diagnose which transition zone is creating friction, and apply the Cascading Context Map when organizational direction is vague or absent.

This is not a seniority hierarchy. A PM operating at the right altitude for their role is doing excellent work. A Director operating at PM altitude is leaving their actual job undone.

## Key Concepts

### The Two Axes

**Altitude — Scope**
- **PM altitude:** Close to the ground. Customer problems, individual features, sprint priorities, specific team dynamics.
- **Director altitude:** High-level view. Product portfolio, cross-functional systems, organizational dynamics, budget allocation, market positioning.
- The shift is not about losing empathy for customers — it's about zooming out to see the entire restaurant, not just one table.

**Horizon — Time**
- **PM horizon:** Days, weeks, sprints. A quarter at most.
- **Director horizon:** Quarter as the starting point. Annual planning cycles, multi-year strategy, market shifts.
- Directors plan for where the product ecosystem needs to be in a year, then work backward.

### The Waiter vs. Restaurant Operator

The sharpest analogy for the role shift:

| Dimension | PM (Waiter) | Director (Restaurant Operator) |
|---|---|---|
| Focus | Individual diner experience | Entire system — staffing, margins, menu, suppliers |
| Authority | Influence without control | Portfolio decisions, budget, resource allocation |
| Success metric | Table seven is happy | Restaurant is profitable, consistent, and scalable |
| Relationship to customers | Direct, daily, intimate | Aggregate patterns, buyer personas, market cohorts |
| Failure mode | Ignoring Table Seven's needs | Obsessing over Table Seven's lemons |

The waiter excels at translating the experience of individual diners. The operator isn't ignoring diners — they're asking different questions: "Are we overspending on ingredients? Is a 75-page menu confusing customers? Do we need another server for the dinner rush?" Neither question is more important in absolute terms. They're appropriate to different roles.

### Four Transition Zones

The PM → Director shift requires movement across four zones. Most people struggle with one or two more than the others — diagnosing which one is the leverage point.

**Zone 1 — Thinking Altitude**
- Stop: Solving individual customer problems directly
- Start: Designing systems and teams that solve classes of problems

**Zone 2 — Persona Shift**
- Stop: Obsessing over individual user personas and daily customer touchpoints
- Start: Thinking in buyer personas, market cohorts, organizational stakeholders, and executive dynamics

**Zone 3 — Hero Syndrome Recovery**
- Stop: Being the person who saves the day and earns the pat on the back
- Start: Getting satisfaction from team success — your product is your people, not the roadmap

**Zone 4 — Direction Creation**
- Stop: Waiting for clear direction from above before moving
- Start: Creating context cascades that translate company strategy into team clarity, even when inputs are incomplete

### Named Failure Modes

**Hero Syndrome**
What it looks like: Jumping in to solve problems directly. Staying close to the tactical work. Wanting visibility on individual wins.
Why it happens: PMs are trained to be helpful and responsive. Directors get fewer pats on the back, so they regress to the old reward loop.
The cost: You under-perform as a Director while over-functioning as a senior IC. Your team doesn't develop because you're in their way.

**Allergic to Process**
What it looks like: Resisting shared structures. Letting high-performing PMs run their own playbooks independently.
Why it happens: PMs naturally resist bureaucracy. Early director permissiveness can feel like "great leadership" and "trusting the team."
The cost: Stakeholders across marketing, finance, and leadership can't synthesize inconsistent outputs. Without shared processes, teams become "monkeys in the room breaking glass."

**People-Pleaser Leadership**
What it looks like: Wanting the team to like you. Avoiding hard feedback. Saying yes to stakeholder requests to preserve relationships.
Why it happens: The skills that made you a great PM — listening, empathy, responsiveness — become liabilities at organizational scale.
The cost: You confuse "popular" with "effective." Respect is built through clarity and hard calls, not niceness.

**Instant Gratification Trap**
What it looks like: Reading leadership books, collecting certifications, asking "what do I need to do to get promoted?"
Why it happens: PMs are good at optimization. They try to shortcut the experience requirement.
The cost: Director readiness requires war stories and lived humility. You can study your way to fluency in the vocabulary, but not to readiness for the role.

**Black-and-White Thinking**
What it looks like: "This seems like an obvious decision." "Why can't we fund both?" "Why is everything so political here?"
Why it happens: PMs operate in cleaner problem spaces with clearer cause-and-effect. Director decisions involve competing constraints, limited information, and organizational dynamics.
The cost: Fast decisions with low confidence create downstream chaos. The grayscale is not a failure of leadership — it's the actual terrain.

### The Cascading Context Map

When organizational direction is vague or absent, Directors don't wait — they cascade.

**The six steps:**

1. **Listen to the top-level strategy** — QBRs, company messaging, executive communications
2. **Extract key priorities leadership stated** — Identify 3–5 themes, not 20 bullet points
3. **Map the second layer:** "How does our business unit accomplish these objectives?"
4. **Map the third layer:** "How does our product portfolio accomplish that?"
5. **Map the fourth layer:** "What are my team's specific accountabilities that drive success at layer three?"
6. **Communicate the cascade to the team** — Not just what to do, but why it connects upward

**What this fixes:** Teams "wandering in the wilderness" — shipping work that doesn't connect to strategy because the context was never translated for them.

**The core principle:** Even with incomplete direction from above, a Director's job is to fill the gap downward. Waiting for perfect clarity is a PM habit. Creating imperfect-but-useful clarity is a Director skill.

## Application

### Using This Framework as a PM (Pre-Transition)

1. Identify which transition zone you're weakest in — not to act on it yet, but to know what to observe
2. Use 1-on-1s with your manager to practice Zone 4: "How does my work connect to business strategy? What's the organizational context I'm not seeing?"
3. Watch for Hero Syndrome habits now: do you jump in to solve things that others could solve with your coaching?
4. Don't over-invest in Director thinking while you're still in a PM role. Serve your current scope with full commitment — director altitude will be available when the context requires it

### Using This Framework as a Newly Promoted Director

1. **First 30 days:** Draw your new Altitude & Horizon map. Who are your new stakeholders? What does a quarter-to-annual planning horizon actually look like in this organization?
2. **First 60 days:** Identify your Hero Syndrome triggers. When do you feel the pull to jump in directly instead of coaching?
3. **First 90 days:** Run your first Cascading Context Map. Even if company strategy is unclear, make your best translation and share it with your team
4. **Ongoing:** When friction appears, name which transition zone it lives in. Diagnosis before prescription

### Running a Cascading Context Map

Use when your team is unclear on what organizational strategy means for their work.

```markdown
## Context Cascade

**Company Priority:** [What leadership said — in their words]
**Business Unit Translation:** [How your BU contributes to that priority]
**Product Portfolio Translation:** [How your products contribute to that]
**Team Accountabilities:** [What each team owns specifically]
**Why this matters:** [The so-what for your team — what changes, what stays the same]
```

One page is better than ten. The goal is clarity, not comprehensiveness.

## Examples

See `examples/sample.md` for a full worked scenario with a completed Cascading Context Map and anti-pattern contrast.

### Good: Director Creates Clarity from a Vague Company Priority

**Situation:** CEO announces at QBR: "We're doubling down on enterprise." Three PMs ask their Director: "What does that mean for our roadmaps?"

**PM response (wrong altitude):** "Let's add enterprise features to our sprint backlogs."

**Director response (right altitude):** Runs a Cascading Context Map. Translates: "Enterprise means larger deal sizes, longer sales cycles, and more integration requirements. For our portfolio: Product A owns the admin controls story, Product B owns the API documentation story, Product C owns the security certification story. Here's what changes in Q3 planning and what doesn't."

**Why it works:** Director didn't wait for more clarity. They created it from available signal.

---

### Bad: Hero Syndrome in Action

**Situation:** A PM on the team is struggling with a difficult stakeholder relationship.

**Director response (wrong):** "Let me just talk to that stakeholder directly — I'll get it sorted out."

**Director response (right):** "Walk me through what you've tried. Let's figure out where it broke down and what you'll do differently."

**Why it matters:** The first response solves the problem and creates dependency. The second response grows the PM. Directors who rescue too often build teams that can't function without them.

---

### Good: Shifting from Waiter to Operator

**Situation:** A high-performing PM insists on documenting requirements in a different format from the rest of the team because "my stakeholders prefer it."

**Director response (wrong):** "That's fine, she's our best PM — if it works for her team, let it go."

**Director response (right):** "Joe is crushing it individually. But when marketing tries to synthesize across all three PMs' work, they can't. Shared process isn't bureaucracy — it's what makes the system legible to everyone outside it."

**Why it matters:** Protecting high-performer exceptions creates invisible coordination costs. The Restaurant Operator's job is the system, not the star waiter.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Altitude Theater
**Symptom:** Using strategy language ("portfolio," "ecosystem," "long-term vision") while still making sprint-level decisions

**Consequence:** You sound like a Director but function like a PM. Your team is confused about who's actually deciding and at what level.

**Fix:** If you're in the details, own it. If you're not, delegate it fully. Mixing altitude levels without signaling creates ambiguity that erodes team trust.

---

### Pitfall 2: One-and-Done Context Cascade
**Symptom:** Running the Cascading Context Map once at annual planning, then never revisiting it

**Consequence:** Team aligns in Q1 and drifts as strategy evolves. By Q3, team work is decoupled from current priorities.

**Fix:** Revisit the cascade at major inflection points — quarterly planning, significant exec changes, pivots, or org restructuring.

---

### Pitfall 3: Confusing Kindness with Leadership
**Symptom:** Shielding the team from hard decisions, over-explaining constraints you're holding, softening feedback into meaninglessness

**Consequence:** Team operates without accurate context; trust erodes when reality eventually lands without warning.

**Fix:** Be transparent about the "why" behind hard decisions. You don't need to share everything — but what you share should be honest and actionable.

---

### Pitfall 4: Premature Director Thinking as a PM
**Symptom:** Spending PM years worried about portfolio strategy, organizational dynamics, and "thinking above your pay grade"

**Consequence:** You under-serve your current role. PMs who think like Directors often miss the customer-level signal their actual role requires.

**Fix:** Play your current role with full commitment. The transition will demand Director thinking soon enough — you'll be ready because you did your PM work well, not because you rehearsed the Director role prematurely.
