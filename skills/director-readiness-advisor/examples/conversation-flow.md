# Example: Director Readiness Advisor Conversation Flow

This shows a complete interaction for a PM who is preparing for Director interviews.

---

## Scenario

The user is a senior PM, 4-6 months from interview loops, and strong on execution but weak on strategic narrative.

---

## Step 0: Initial Request

**User:**
"I want to move from PM to Director this year. I am not sure what I am missing."

**Agent:**
"I can help you diagnose the transition challenge and pick the highest-leverage next moves.

First, choose your situation:

1. Preparing to make the leap
2. Interviewing for Director roles
3. Newly landed in a Director role
4. Recalibrating after being in role for a while"

**User:** "1"

---

## Step 1: Situational Diagnosis

**Agent:**
"What feels hardest right now?

1. Delegation and letting go of IC work
2. Leading through other PMs
3. Strategic narrative and context translation
4. Managing up and cross-functional influence"

**User:** "3"

**Agent:**
"How soon do you expect to start interviewing?

1. 0-3 months
2. 3-6 months
3. 6+ months"

**User:** "2"

## Step 2: Branch-Specific Coaching Output

**Agent output:**

"You are in the Preparing branch with a Strategic Narrative gap and 3-6 months runway.

Recommended focus:

1. Build your cascade muscle weekly
- Each week, pick one company priority and translate it into:
  - business impact
  - portfolio implication
  - team-level implications
- Practice saying this out loud in one sentence per layer.

2. Reframe your 1:1 with your manager
- Ask: 'Which decisions in our area need Director-level framing right now?'
- Bring one draft context cascade to each 1:1 for feedback.

3. Upgrade your interview story stack
- Prepare 3 stories:
  - created clarity from ambiguity
  - developed a PM instead of rescuing execution
  - aligned competing stakeholders around a portfolio trade-off

4. Run a Hero Syndrome audit
- Track 2 weeks of your calendar:
  - how much time in IC problem solving
  - how much time coaching PM judgment
- If IC load is high, pick two recurring tasks to hand off intentionally.

5. Practice Director language
- Replace 'I shipped' with 'I created the system and decisions that enabled teams to deliver.'
- Emphasize leverage, not personal heroics."
