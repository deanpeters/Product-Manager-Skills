## Purpose

Structure the first 90 days of a VP or CPO transition as a diagnostic process, not an execution sprint. The single most common failure in senior product leadership transitions is acting before understanding — changing structures, replacing people, or announcing strategy before building the evidence base that makes those decisions defensible.

This playbook runs in three phases: **Diagnose** (Month 1), **Validate** (Month 2), **Act with Evidence** (Month 3). Each phase builds on the last. Skipping phases doesn't accelerate results — it guarantees expensive reversals.

This is not a 100-day plan for impressing your new boss. It's a diagnostic protocol for making durable decisions.

## Key Concepts

### The Consultant Mindset

Enter every new VP/CPO role as if you're an external consultant hired to assess the organization — before you're the person responsible for changing it.

What this means in practice:
- **Observe before diagnosing.** Don't form opinions in the first week based on first impressions.
- **Ask questions before making declarations.** "Help me understand how this works" is more powerful than "here's what we're going to do differently."
- **Understand how the steering connects to the rudder.** In any organization, there are systems and relationships that look one way on paper and work completely differently in practice. Map that reality before you touch anything.
- **Don't throw the big red switch.** If you walked into a power plant you'd never operated before and saw a large red switch, you probably wouldn't throw it. The same logic applies to org structures, processes, reporting lines, and team compositions you've inherited. Understand what they control first.

Negotiate this upfront: tell your boss and peers that Month 1 is explicitly a learning phase. Set the expectation that your first major recommendations will come in Month 2. Executives who've been through transitions will respect this; executives who want action in Week 1 are a signal worth noting.

### Unwritten Strategy

At VP and CPO level, significant strategy is never fully written down. It lives in:
- The CEO's head, shaped by conversations you weren't in
- Board meeting dynamics and investor preferences
- Last night's executive dinner
- Off-the-record conversations between founders
- Tribal knowledge that long-tenured leaders treat as obvious

This isn't dysfunction — it's how every organization works at the executive level. Treating written strategy as complete strategy will get you into trouble fast.

Your job in the first 90 days is to surface the unwritten layer. How:
- Ask indirect questions: "What's the history here?" / "How did we end up with this approach?" / "What did we try before that didn't work?"
- Let information find you. People who want to shape the new leader's perspective will seek you out. Take those meetings. Take notes.
- Reality-check with your boss: "Here's what I'm hearing from the organization. This is different from what you told me. Help me understand." This is not confrontational — it's how you triangulate toward the truth.

---

### The Body of Evidence

Every significant decision you make in Month 3 and beyond should rest on a body of evidence collected in Months 1 and 2. This means:
- Detailed notes from every diagnostic conversation
- Patterns noted across multiple independent sources (not just one vocal person)
- Reality-checks completed with your manager and key peers
- A clear picture of what's working, what's broken, and why

The body of evidence is what separates confident decisions from guesses. It's also what makes hard decisions defensible — to your team, to your peers, and to the board.

---

### People Assessment: Two Categories

Two distinct people situations require different responses:

**Diamonds in the rough** — Capable, undervalued people who haven't had a champion. They exist in almost every organization. You'll find them in Months 1-2 by listening for: "She's really talented but nobody gives her the hard problems" or noticing who gives you the most useful, unvarnished information in your diagnostic interviews. These people become critical early allies.

**Strong people in wrong roles** — Not weak performers; people whose strengths are mismatched to their current scope. This is more common in organizations that grew fast, went through acquisitions, or promoted based on tenure. A former sales rep who became a PM because they knew the product. A brilliant individual contributor managing a team that needs a coach. These situations require honest, compassionate conversations — coach up if they're coachable, find them another role, or part ways. All three outcomes are better than leaving the mismatch in place.

---

### Phase 0: Before Day 1

If you're evaluating whether to take the role, use this phase to interview the organization before it interviews you.

**Five questions to probe with the hiring CEO:**

1. "What are you expecting from the product organization in the first 90 days? The first year?" — Surfaces unrealistic transformation timelines early. Red flag: "I expect the roadmap to be fully overhauled by Q2."

2. "Who are the all-stars on your product team, and why?" — Reveals the CEO's perceptions and biases. They're often wrong, but knowing their mental model matters.

3. "Who has gaps, and why?" — What does the CEO believe the org's weakness is? Is it accurate?

4. "What constraints are we working with that I should understand upfront?" — Financial, organizational, market. Understand your actual degrees of freedom before you accept.

5. "What does success look like for this role at one year?" — Force specificity. Vague answers ("transformed the product culture") are red flags. Specific answers ("85% on-time delivery, two new enterprise accounts, one rebuilt team") are workable.

**Red flags that change the calculus:**
- "You can't change the existing product roadmap" — loss of basic authority before you start
- "We need you to transform the organization in six months" — sets you up to fail
- Misalignment between CEO's talent assessment and what you learn elsewhere in conversations

## Application

### Phase 1: Diagnose (Month 1)

**Objective:** Build the body of evidence. Understand reality, not the official version.

**Step 1: Interview everyone**
Schedule 30-minute conversations with your direct reports, key cross-functional peers (CRO, CFO, CMO, Engineering leadership), and a sample of the PMs in your organization. The question set is simple:
- "What's working well that I should understand and protect?"
- "What's not working that you've been hoping someone would fix?"
- "What do you think I need to know that I probably won't hear in official briefings?"
- "Who are the people in this organization I should make sure to talk to?"

**Step 2: Let people find you**
Don't do all the seeking. Some of the most valuable information comes from people who proactively schedule time with the new leader. They have an agenda — surface it, evaluate it, and note the signal (both in what they say and in that they came to you at all).

**Step 3: Take detailed notes**
Every conversation. Note not just content but context: who said it, what their incentive might be, whether you heard the same thing from multiple independent sources. Patterns that appear across multiple conversations are much more reliable than strong opinions from single sources.

**Step 4: Resist action**
When you see something obviously broken in Month 1, your instinct will be to fix it. Resist. You don't yet have the context to know why it's broken, whether previous attempts to fix it failed, or what it's connected to. Note it in your evidence log instead.

**Deliverable:** A detailed notebook of organizational reality, not yet interpreted.

---

### Phase 2: Validate (Month 2)

**Objective:** Surface patterns, challenge your emerging conclusions, identify the people situations.

**Step 1: Reality-check with your boss**
Take your emerging picture of the organization back to your manager:
- "I'm hearing [X] from multiple people. This is different from what I understood coming in. Help me understand the history."
- "I'm seeing [Y] pattern across the team. Is that consistent with what you've observed?"

This is not confrontational. It's how you separate signal from noise and build a shared baseline of organizational reality.

**Step 2: Map the unwritten strategy**
By now you've had enough conversations to start seeing the gap between stated priorities and actual organizational behavior. Ask directly: "What does the organization actually optimize for when things get hard?" The answer is usually different from the mission statement.

**Step 3: Complete your people assessment**
By end of Month 2, you should have a preliminary read on:
- Who your diamonds in the rough are (and how to give them more scope)
- Who is strong but in the wrong role (and what the right conversation looks like)
- Who is genuinely not coachable to the level the org needs (and what timeline is appropriate)

**Step 4: Identify your 3-5 highest-leverage changes**
Not a full transformation plan — three to five specific changes that would most improve organizational effectiveness. These become your Month 3 agenda.

**Deliverable:** An interpreted organizational assessment with people map and initial strategic priorities.

---

### Phase 3: Act with Evidence (Month 3)

**Objective:** Begin making decisions grounded in the body of evidence. Introduce structure and direction, not transformation.

**Step 1: Share your organizational assessment**
Don't keep it private. Bring your key findings to your boss and your direct reports: "Here's what I've learned about how this organization works, where it's strong, and where it needs to develop. Here's my initial plan for the next quarter." This builds trust through transparency and surfaces disagreements before you act on them.

**Step 2: Run your first Cascading Context Map**
Use the organizational and strategic clarity you've built to create direction for your team — even if company strategy above you is still ambiguous. (See `skills/altitude-horizon-framework/SKILL.md` for the full technique.) Your team has been waiting for context. Give them your best current translation and commit to refining it.

**Step 3: Start the people conversations**
Now that you have evidence, have the hard conversations:
- Diamonds in the rough: give them a stretch assignment or expanded scope
- People in wrong roles: a direct, honest conversation about the mismatch and the options
- Exits: begin with honesty and care, not avoidance

**Step 4: Build your executive alliance deliberately**
By Month 3 you know who the key players are and what they need from product. Start the weekly alignment practice: regular touchpoints with CRO, CFO, and CMO to ensure they understand product's priorities and the trade-offs being made. Don't wait for them to be surprised. (See `skills/vp-cpo-readiness-advisor/SKILL.md` for the Alliance Building branch.)

**Deliverable:** A shared organizational assessment, an initial strategic direction, and three to five active changes underway with clear rationale.

## Examples

See `examples/sample.md` for a full 30-60-90 diagnostic walkthrough with concrete artifacts and decisions by month.

### Good: Consultant Mindset Preventing a Costly Mistake

**Situation:** New CPO joins and immediately notices the team's longest-tenured PM is resistant, slow to deliver, and visibly unpopular with engineering.

**Impulsive response:** Put her on a performance plan in Month 1.

**Consultant response:** Keeps notes, asks questions. Discovers in Month 2 that she's the only person on the team who understands the legacy platform's architecture — and that a previous CPO already tried to push her out, creating the defensive behavior. She's strong but in the wrong role (PM scope requires stakeholder management she struggles with; technical architecture is where she adds irreplaceable value).

**Outcome:** She's moved into a technical product owner role by Month 3. Engineering's delivery velocity improves. The CPO avoids destroying an irreplaceable relationship.

---

### Bad: Acting Before Understanding

**Situation:** New VP of Product hears in Week 2 that three PMs each have completely different formats for their roadmap documentation. She standardizes them in Week 3.

**What she didn't know:** Each format exists because of specific requirements from different internal stakeholder groups. The "inconsistency" was a feature, not a bug.

**Outcome:** Three sets of stakeholders lose the views they relied on. The VP spends Month 2 rebuilding goodwill she spent three weeks burning.

**The diagnostic question she should have asked first:** "Why does each team use a different format? What would break if they were unified?"

---

### Good: Surfacing Unwritten Strategy

**Situation:** VP joins a company whose stated priority is "enterprise expansion." After 30 diagnostic conversations, he realizes the CEO has a specific enterprise customer in mind — a reference customer that would unlock a Series B — that has never been mentioned in any written strategy document.

**How it surfaces:** He asks an indirect question in his Month 2 reality-check: "When you imagine what success looks like at the end of this year, what does the portfolio look like?" The CEO mentions the target customer by name.

**Outcome:** The VP realigns two product teams' priorities around the capabilities that matter to that specific customer. Strategy becomes executable. Without surfacing the unwritten layer, he would have pursued a generic enterprise strategy that didn't move the actual needle.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Performing Action Instead of Building Evidence
**Symptom:** Making structural announcements or process changes in Month 1 to signal decisive leadership

**Consequence:** You build on incomplete understanding. Reversals in Month 3 damage credibility more than patience in Month 1 would have.

**Fix:** Reframe patience as methodology, not passivity. "I'm in diagnostic mode for the first 30 days" is a confident statement when said clearly to your boss and team.

---

### Pitfall 2: Staying in Consultant Mode Too Long
**Symptom:** Still gathering information in Month 3; no visible actions or decisions

**Consequence:** Organizational confidence erodes. People start to wonder if the new leader has opinions. Your boss starts to wonder if you can make decisions.

**Fix:** Month 3 is the action phase. You won't have complete information — no one ever does. Act on your best current evidence and commit to learning from what follows.

---

### Pitfall 3: Trusting the Loudest Voice
**Symptom:** Forming early opinions based on the most vocal, most accessible, or most persuasive person you met in Month 1

**Consequence:** You adopt one person's organizational narrative as ground truth. Decisions built on single-source information collapse when the rest of the organization provides context.

**Fix:** Pattern-match across multiple independent conversations. Only act on themes you've heard from three or more unrelated sources.

---

### Pitfall 4: Skipping the CEO Interview (Before Accepting)
**Symptom:** Taking the CPO role without probing constraints, expectations, and talent assessment upfront

**Consequence:** You walk into a situation where the roadmap is locked, the timeline is impossible, or the CEO's mental model of the team is so wrong that your first six months are spent managing their misperceptions instead of leading.

**Fix:** The five questions in Phase 0 are not optional. Walk away from roles where the answers reveal fundamental misalignment. No role is worth a death march.

---

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Executive Dysfunction
**Symptom:** Assuming that executive staff meetings will be mature, collaborative, and politics-free

**Consequence:** You're blindsided by alliances, personal agendas, and interpersonal dynamics that operate beneath the surface of every executive team.

**Fix:** Expect dysfunction. Patrick Lencioni's *Five Dysfunctions of a Team* applies to leadership teams as much as any other. Integrity gets tested more at higher levels, not less. Map the alliances in Month 1 as carefully as you map the product portfolio.
