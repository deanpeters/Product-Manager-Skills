## Short Promotional Post

Still rewriting PM prompts and getting generic AI output? That is not a workflow. That is Groundhog Day with worse formatting.

I built a reusable PM Agent Skills repo to help you make sharper decisions, cleaner docs, and better outcomes faster.

After 20 years in Product Management, and 15 years before that as a software engineer, my mission now is simple: send the ladder down.

I am proud of the work I have done over the last 3.5 years at Productside.com, and genuinely excited to share this.

Two years ago I published:
[my prompting repo](https://github.com/deanpeters/product-manager-prompts)

Now I am excited to share:
[Product Manager Skills](https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills)

If you are done with one-off prompting and ready for repeatable execution, this is for you.

Product Management Skills for Your Agents

Why I Open-Sourced My Product Manager Skills Library

### Article Body

Still rewriting PM prompts and getting generic AI output? That is not AI leverage. That is prompt roulette.

I built a reusable PM Agent Skills repo to help PMs make sharper decisions, clearer docs, and better outcomes:

-   [**https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills**](https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills)

### The backstory matters.

Fifteen years as a software engineer. Twenty years in Product Management. That path gave me one permanent bias: I care less about elegant theories and more about whether the thing actually works when your roadmap meeting starts in 90 minutes.

Over those two decades, I've watched the same pattern repeat: smart PMs with weak systems. Not because they're lazy. Not because they lack talent. But because most PM guidance arrives in one of three flavors: fluffy inspiration, academic abstraction, or advice so vague it's useless by Tuesday morning.

### My mission now is simple: send the ladder down.

That's why I'm proud of the work I've done over the last 3.5 years at [**Productside.com**](http://productside.com/) (*to a person, I've never worked with a better group of people*). It's also why this repo exists.

### Three weekends. Three versions. Zero prompt archaeology.

Most PMs are drowning in **prompt archaeology**. Digging through old chats, reconstructing context, rewriting the same ask seventeen different ways to get something usable.

That is not productivity. That is a tax on thinking.

Two years ago, I hand-crafted this gift for the product management community: [**https://github.com/deanpeters/product-manager-prompts**](https://github.com/deanpeters/product-manager-prompts)

Prompts in 2024 were useful. Prompts in 2026 are one-off sugar highs.

The Anthropic standard for [**Agent Skills**](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) are reusable operating systems.

I re-imagined my prompts and the standard:

-   **v0.05** (Feb 1): *Migrated* my Product Manager Prompts repo into the Agent Skills format

-   **v0.1** (Feb 4): Added skills *derived* from my ‘[**Confessions of a Feature Factory Escapee**](https://deanpeters.substack.com/)’ Substack, crafted with Claude, battle-tested with Codex

-   **v0.2** (Feb 8): Added metrics *inspired* by Productside's OPM, DPM, and AI [**Product Management**](https://productside.com/product-management-courses/) courses. Also added ‘Add-a-Skill’, ‘Build-a-Skill’, and ‘Test-a-Skill’ utilities.

Same workflow: Claude sketches with artistry. Codex holds it to standards with adult supervision.

### What's inside.

Component skills for key artifacts. Interactive skills for guided decisions. Workflow skills for end-to-end execution.

Repeatable. Professional. Actually works.

### But How?

#### Question from the audience:

>   Dean, do I need Claude Code, or Claude Cowork, or the Claude Chatbot to use these Agent Skills?

#### Answer from the sleep deprived:

>   No! Like MCP, the Agent Skills is an Anthropic standard rapidly being adopted by many vendors and publishers of chatbots and agents.

### Feedback welcome.

Experienced PM? I want your pushback. Early in your journey? I hope this helps you skip some pain and ship better work faster.

Don’t believe me? I’m teaching the [**March 16-19 AI PM Cohort**](https://productside.com/ai-product-management-training-course/). Let me show you.

Want even more gory details on how I put this together? I'll be posting that learning journey on my Substack later this week.

No hype. No PM cosplay. Just real AI PM sh!t that works.
